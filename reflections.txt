You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
The skills that have learnt are:
	- how to add heading element to html page
	- how to add image element to html page
	- how to make a text bold and italized
	- how to strikethrough a text
	- how to add horizontal rule
	- how to add a superscript elememt to html page

What has been easy are 
	- adding heading element
	- adding strong and emphasized element
	- adding strike through element

What has not been easy are 
	- converting a markdown code to html link
	- the part that has to do with adding absolute and relative path.

The way have used the problem solving strategies from the first project is that 
	- i first analyzes the mockup
	- finding what text change
	- finding if there was image in the mockup
	- and then making my html page to look exactly like the mockup.
